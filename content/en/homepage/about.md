title: We love good coffee and want to share it with everybody
description: "We are on a mission to make good coffee - specialty coffee - accessible to everyone. We believe that good coffee is more than just a drink; it's an experience that should be enjoyed by all. That's why we have created a map of the best coffee places, a podcast to discuss all things coffee, and a journal where we share our passion for good coffee.
<br /><br/>
Our goal is simple - to make good coffee mainstream. We believe that by educating and sharing our knowledge, we can inspire more people to appreciate the art of specialty coffee. So join us on this journey, as we explore the world of good coffee and discover all the amazing things it has to offer."

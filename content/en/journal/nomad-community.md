## What is your favourite coffee?

During my training, I discovered the cortado. I really like milky drinks but I still want to taste the coffee.

## Explain the concept. Why a coworking café?

When I left my job, I launched an e-commerce selling decoration fabrics. Plaids, cushions, small merchandising and much more. During that time, I began to look for places to work from to not be home on my own. I tried the classic coffee places, with a nice atmosphere, sockets to power your computer and good coffee. It seemed to be a good match.

I rapidly felt that those places were not comfortable and a bit noisy. You find yourself listening to the conversation at the table on your side, unable to concentrate. The wifi is too weak to work or doesn't work at all. The furniture is too low for your back. A friend gave me a solution: the coworking space.

I tried the coworking offices in Brussels. The offices are amazing and well designed but I still felt like in a corporate world with few solopreneurs. Visiting a supplier in Paris, I discovered a new way of doing coworking, a coffee shop that doubles as a coworking.

Thinking about what I saw in Paris I searched for coworking cafés in Brussels and didn't find any. Willing to create a place and missing contact with people on a day-to-day basis, I decided to give it a go and create my own place.

## Who are your customers?

A lot of solopreneurs, freelancers that work by themself or small businesses of two or three. Some are people that work from home. Working from home is great but sometimes it isn't suitable. Kids playing around, work in progress in the street, people passing by, there are a million reasons for it not being suitable. Or you don't have a real office and find yourself working from your bed or on the sofa in front of the tv.

Sometimes, I also have some students or people launching their businesses. Meeting with people gives them the opportunity to share their ideas and have constructive feedback. You can also meet some creatives, they come here to do their administrative work and don't leave until the work is done.

## How did you find the place?

That was the hardest part of the project. The place I am in now, I found it thanks to Abiz, a B2B estate agency that has lots of references for places in Brussels.

Before that, I used to look on Immoweb, a famous Belgian web property website. I became an expert. I was able to find where the place was, the history of the building, the assignment of the place and who was there before. For a brief moment, I thought about becoming a real estate.

I began to hunt for the perfect spot in February 2020, the Covid came by and stopped everything. I got back to looking after it and found the place after a lot of disappointment or avoided mistakes in march 2021.

## Did you have an idea of the places you were looking for?

I wanted something big, minimum of 100 square meters, with lots of natural light and accessible by public transport.

I wanted it to be in Schaerbeek, Ixelles, Brussels, Saint-Gilles or Uccle. And it was mandatory to be a Food & Beverage assignment. We serve coffee and food and I didn't want to have a problem with it.

## So, how big is this place?

It's 130 square meters but with small bits on the side: the toilets, the kitchen and the small meeting room. There are around 90 square meters accessible to the public.

## What do you like the most about the place?

The light, the wood counter and the canopy. When I enter in the morning, I like to see the light that passes by the windows.

## How long did it take to launch the project?

In September 2019, I had the idea, I joined Crédal, a support structure that helps you launch your idea. The place opened on the 25th of October, 2021.

I guess you can be faster but the place hunting and the Covid took a big dent on it. We put a lot of pressure on the work inside. We began to destroy walls in June 2021 and finished in September.

But the most time-consuming was to await the administrative part. You have to wait for the visit of the firefighters and send a document to the town hall. And then, you have to wait to get an official document that says you can open the place. I waited 3 weeks to have it.

## What are the problems you met along the way?

Obviously, the place hunting. The design of the place was challenging. It's difficult to imagine something in your head and then explain it to the entrepreneur. You have ideas for the walls and the floor but as everything is protected for the work in progress, you don't know if everything will work together. It's stressful.

## If you had to do it again, would you seek help for this part?

Maybe. I like designing a space, that's something fun. I was lucky because the building is already pretty, in the end, I only placed furniture. It's true that I didn't create a space from scratch. In the future, if I want to create a second place, I might ask someone to do it, that way I can keep the identity of the place. And if I have the money...

## What is your final budget for the place?

I never really stopped on the numbers, I would say around 60.000€. Renovation, furniture and everything I need to run the place, I bought some stuff from second-hand shops, like the fridge.

## What was your inspiration for the place?

I went to other places. Every time I tried to sense what I liked in there. What did I like about the place? Was it the colours, the furniture, the atmosphere? And also what creates a place where I feel good: wood and plants, for example.

I hesitated for a long time to introduce colours. I like the bold colours used in Colombia and Mexico, bright, well-balanced and mixed. But I didn't feel confident doing it by myself. I found ideas on Pinterest as well and bit by bit everything came into place. That's a great feeling to look at what you saved as inspiration and see what you have accomplished.

## Did your e-commerce experience help you to build the place?

Yes and no. It gave me the opportunity to discover new brands and accounts. But in the end, I did it low budget. When I began to furnish the space, we were in 2021, and, as you know, all the commerce was out of stock for a lot of stuff. I ordered some furniture from Ikea then I went to the thrift stores to find chairs, plates, vases, the rug,... my accountant was not happy! But it gives an authentic side to the place.

## Did you seek external help to launch?

Low. Budget. The least I spent the better. I am quite a pessimist and as I am on my own, I wanted to keep the investment as low as possible.

I answered a graphic design school that was looking for a real project to work on. I pitched my idea to a class of 10 students with only one girl. They had to come up with a name for the project and, funny thing, they agreed on the name Nomad. I already chose the name but didn't give it.

They worked on the logo and they all came with a cabin, a yurt and a tent idea except for the girl. She had the idea with the coloured stained that I used to describe the different activities of Nomad. It's priceless for communication. The M describe movement, mountains, dunes and travel. And she described the star as the North Star that guides you. I liked it a lot!

My accountant is a friend that came in at the beginning of the project. That way, the tax strategy of the company was upstream, everything was already anticipated before I even opened.

[Subsiconseils](https://www.subsiconseils.be/). They say they are "Chasseur de primes", they find the state bonuses you could have. I knew I could have some but I was a bit too lazy to do all the paperwork to have them. It helped me a lot.

Thomas from [Ok coffee](http://okcoffee.tips/) helped me with the coffee. I order the coffee from his supplier, [Or Coffee](https://orcoffee.be/), and he helped me choose my coffee machine. When you launch a coffee place, the first brand that comes to mind is Marzocco but it was a bit expensive for me. I went with the brand La Nueva Era. The guy that sells them is in Belgium and I can call him if I have a problem. I'm not doing a lot of coffee during the day and it will be of no use for me to have an expensive espresso machine.

## What advice would you give someone who wants to launch a coffee place?

Work in a F&B place before to know what it's like. Think about your space behind the counter and in the kitchen. I didn't and sometimes I wish I gave it more time. Keep in mind that you'll grow and have space to spread out. Buy your furniture and material to last. You don't want to change it often.

When you launch, do it step by step. Don't try to launch everything all at once. I tried to do lunch and every weekend I stressed about what to cook, if I had enough material, etc... You will not have all the material at the start of the project and it's all right. When you buy in case of, you end up with lots of stuff you don't use. You'll find the user needs when you have users. First, take the time to be known by the neighbours and have customers. If you stress yourself to have everything as perfect as possible, you'll be demotivated before launching.

Take professional photos, right at the beginning. Share the backstage and talk about what's happening. People like to see how a project evolves and see the before-after.

## What's your motivation to get out of bed?

Meet new people. I am not a morning person and knowing that I will meet new people is great. It's always a surprise, you never know who you are going to meet.

## Do you find a work-life balance?

At the beginning of the project, not at all. I have a kid and a husband. There was a lot to do, I was always here during the week and the weekend, I had to get furniture or do some minor work,... I began to feel stuck in my own place. It's a sentiment that's shared by a lot of people that manage a place, especially when you're solo. You have to be here all day long, you can't take a lunch break to eat with friends. And it becomes hard to keep the love you had for your project.

To fight that, I decided to only work 4 days a week. The Friday someone else takes care of the place. It gives me the opportunity to drive my kid to school, work on other projects, do small chores and spend quality time with my kid after school.

I find a balance by taking less time closing, my goal every evening is to be home as early as possible. My weekend is dedicated to my family, except if there is an event at Nomad. My family calibrates their time according to Nomad. It helps that my husband is quite flexible and works from home. But my social life has fallen sharply.

## Something you don't talk much about is the fact that you try to be zero waste. Why is that?

I don't talk about it because today, it's not a value anymore but more of a duty. It's the norm, it's what people look for, you breathe, you drink water and you take care of the planet.

I try to be zero waste and it's not that easy. I distribute the coffee pond to my neighbour for their plants. If a supplier can't deliver in reusable containers, I don't make a deal with him. I work with [Billie cup](https://billiecup.com), a reusable cup you can exchange for any coffee that uses them. I give leftovers to [Too Good To Go](https://www.toogoodtogo.com). The merchandising is eco-friendly and all the makers are local, Belgian or are mindful of the impact of their product. For that, I work with [Teroirist](https://www.instagram.com/terroirist_bxl) who knows the market. Part of the furniture is second-hand.

Some things are harder to implement. For example, I wanted to use towels in the toilets. But, if I want to use it, I have to have one towel per use and I'm not sure that it's more ecological than using paper.

I do it as much as I can because it's the basis for everything now and you can't sell it as part of who you are.

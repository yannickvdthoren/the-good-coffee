## 1. Not overly marketed

Taking a reference from nature and its beautiful creatures, the shinier and brighter they are on the outside, the more venomous they are on the inside. We all have examples of brands popping into our heads while thinking about cafes where everything seems fake and forced: big pictures of coffee beans on the wall, lots of marketing merchandising to buy, a lot of hype for the place, the queue that's well organized so they are sure that you'll pass in front of everything they have to offer before taking your order, overpriced drinks, and so on...

The kind of coffee places you want to spot are the small ones, the ones you barely notice from the street where the baristas and waiters seem to be happy to work, where they made what they could with the place and didn't make their design fit the room. Often, these places are made for you to chill inside, to get your coffee and drink it comfortably installed in the best sofa on earth – you want that sofa to come back home with you. There is a sense of welcoming, and you feel like you stepped into a place where people want you to stay. That's the kind of place you want to try to spot.

To summarize, bright and colorful should run like hell on earth. Soft, comfy, and cozy like a Danish living room – you are in the right place.

And yeah, I forgot a major detail: the words "Specialty Coffee" written somewhere on a board or on the menu.

## 2. Coffee brands you never heard about or in close circle

The second step when entering a good coffee place is to try and decipher the menu. Yes, you know what coffee is, and you might even know the difference between a cappuccino and a latte. But what on earth is the name of the coffee being served? Sometimes, you'll even have to choose between two different coffee beans when ordering your drink. That, my friend, is proof that you are in good hands. Having the choice between two types of coffee and a multitude of ways to have your coffee – V60, Chemex, French Press, etc. – is the best indicator that you are in the right place. And if you don't know anything about coffee beans and have no one here to guide you, then…

## 3. … the Barista knows their stuff and can answer your question

Yes. The barista must be an expert in the craft of coffee. For the most part, they are well-trained professionals and their role is not only to create beautiful latte art. Think of them like a bartender who crafts your cocktails on Friday nights. This person will craft the best coffee for your taste. So go ahead, let them take your hand and guide you into the magical world of coffee. They may even be able to surprise you, as I was last time when a barista offered me a taste of a red latte, which was quite an incredible drink!

If they have time, they would even be able to tell you the difference between the beans used in the coffee shop, because there is a difference. A bit like wine, coffee doesn't taste the same if it comes from a certain country and region, and how it was cleaned, dried, and then roasted. It's a whole process, and the barista is here to sublimate it. Therefore, they should be able to tell you why to choose one and not the other.

## 4. The pace for your coffee to arrive

Are you in a rush? Sorry to hear that. I know that in today's world, everything goes faster. You can have whatever you want, whenever you want it super quickly. But coffee, coffee takes time. You don't just push a button to get the drink —well, sometimes, in some cafes, yes, but we don't talk about those ones—. Everything is quite technical and can change from place to place, but it takes around 8 seconds to grind those sweet coffee beans, 28 seconds to get water through the coffee and into your cup, and after that, the time to heat up the milk and pour it, about another 30 seconds. So it takes approximately one minute to make your coffee.

And it should. Coffee is a potion that takes time to brew and be well done. A lot of stuff happens behind a coffee machine, and the barista wants to give you the best coffee possible in each cup. Just sit down and relax, take a deep breath, discuss with people around you, take the time to fully awaken —yes, we know some of you aren't exactly awake when you come for your coffee—. You are in good hands, and soon enough, you'll have a good coffee in your hands.

## 5. Final act, the taste

Good coffee comes in different flavors, so you'll never have the same coffee twice. It's like wine; each year is different, and the region where the beans come from will have a huge impact on your cup of coffee. That's why your coffee might not taste the same from time to time, and anyone who tells you it should never taste good coffee is mistaken.

And that's the best part: each cup you drink is an opportunity to fall in love with a new coffee, discover new flavors, and travel to new parts of the world you have never visited but that are all in your cup. It's really magical. But here's the catch: to drink such coffee, you'll have to say goodbye to the hype of cappuccinos and lattes and begin to drink long black or batch brew. If the coffee is well brewed, it can taste like a really good cup of tea, and you'll taste all the flavors from the coffee. Soon enough, you'll have your favorite regions, and you'll live to drink coffee from that part of the world. Trust me, you'll like it.

And that concludes our 5 points for finding good coffee places. If you need a bit of help with this, I'm actually building a map [where you'll find some of those places](https://the-good-coffee-places.com). So hurry over there and find all the spots where you can drink a good coffee. And if you know of a coffee shop that is not on the map, don't hesitate to [fill out this form](https://tally.so/r/wgaBMO) to give me information about it. In the meantime, I hope your coffee tastes like heaven and that you'll find new coffee shops around your house!

You won't find Honest in one of the touristy streets of Brussels. They opened their café doors in a part of the city where no one had dared to venture before. What stands out immediately upon arrival is the simplicity and discreetness of the building facade. There's no big sign announcing the café, but rather small subtle details like lit lamps outside, lettering on the windows, and wooden signage on the side of the building, indicating that there's something intriguing inside.

As soon as you step inside, you immediately feel the atmosphere of a modern Belgian bistro. Original elements, such as ceiling moldings and swinging doors, have been preserved and cleverly incorporated into the decor, maintaining the soul of the building. The design studio, etudes.architecture, has brought a touch of modernity with furniture like the red-tiled bar and the metal shelf behind it, displaying glasses, and the quirky detail of coffee grounds wallpaper. It's no wonder that the local residents were won over from the opening day, as Elodie shares: "We opened the door, and people from the neighborhood showed up on the first day even before the official opening. And they all say the same thing, that it was missing in the neighborhood."

In addition to being a restaurant, Honest also houses a roastery, a crucial addition without which the project wouldn't have come to life. During the lockdown, Cécile underwent roasting training in Copenhagen and continued to explore this realm upon her return. It seemed natural for her to propose to Elodie to collaborate on opening a place that combines both aspects and allows them to control the origin and taste of their coffee. This bet paid off as the coffee is appreciated both at Honest and La Fabrique en Ville, attracting a different clientele, some less familiar with specialty coffee.

The goal is to grow the brand thoughtfully, as Cécile points out: "We'll develop step by step, ensuring each stage is secure. That way, when we reach a new stage, the groundwork beneath is perfect. We can focus 100% on the new." The upcoming months will focus on creating a new, fruitier and more unique coffee blend, distinct from the current "comfort blend," as well as expanding online sales. There's also a desire to grow the brand without saturating the market while maintaining the same philosophy when opening new establishments, allowing more people to experience the Honest journey. It's an exciting story to follow.

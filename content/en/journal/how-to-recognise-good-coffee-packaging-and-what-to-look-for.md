Recognizing good coffee is achievable by examining the label on the bag and the various information that you can and want to read on it. Here is a list of everything that could be included on a coffee label.

## Single origin or Blend?

The first decision you'll have to make is between Single Origin and Blend. For now, just remember that with Single Origin, the coffee beans are sourced from the same region of the world and the same producer or washing farm. It's a seasonal coffee, so you won't be able to find it year-round. On the other hand, Blend is a combination of different coffee beans that the roaster has skillfully blended together to create a specific flavor profile. This means that each time you purchase this coffee, you can expect the same consistent flavor in your cup.

## The name

Let's discuss an essential aspect of your coffee: its name. The name will serve as a helpful reference for you to easily identify and locate your favorite coffee.

### Blend

When purchasing a blend, the roaster will assign a name to their blend. In most cases, you will come across two types of blends: Filter and Espresso, each with its distinct name.

### Single origin

When it comes to coffee sourced from a specific region, the name of the coffee will always be connected to what you're purchasing. It might be named after the region itself, the washing station, the coffee farm, the producer, the batch, or other relevant factors. The name will serve as an identifier for the specific origin and characteristics of the coffee you're buying.

## Flavors

An essential aspect to consider when making your coffee choice is the taste. The challenge with good coffee is that, similar to wine, each coffee is unique, resulting in distinct flavors. While blends may not showcase individual flavors prominently, single origin coffees tend to have distinct flavor profiles that are noticeable when you drink them. It is important to have an understanding of the potential flavors beforehand, which is why the package often includes information about the flavors present in the coffee.

## Traceability

Numerous details fall under this category, and it is arguably one of the most crucial aspects when it comes to coffee. Good coffee is traceable, meaning that information about its origin and sourcing is readily available. If there is no information provided regarding the coffee's source, it is advisable not to purchase it. Traceability ensures transparency and allows you to make informed decisions about the coffee you buy.

### Blend

For the blend, the traceability will be a little less detailed as more coffee beans are involved in the recipe. However, you should at least find the country for each bean used, sometimes the region, and possibly the ratio present in the bag.

### Single Origin

**Region**

Certainly, this information is the most important. You'll find the country where the coffee beans come from, the region, and sometimes even the city.

**Species**

In the coffee world, there are two species that are commonly used to make coffee: Robusta and Arabica. You should only opt for Arabica coffee. Robusta has a strong taste that may not be as pleasant, and it is primarily used by the coffee industry to blend with Arabica. It is best to avoid it.

**Varietal**

Arabica is a term that encompasses a whole family of trees. Similar to wine, within the Arabica family, you will find different varieties of coffee trees, and these varieties greatly influence the flavors of your coffee.

**Altitude**

Arabica trees typically grow within the altitude range of 600 meters to 2400 meters. The altitude at which the coffee is grown indeed has an impact on the flavor and richness of the taste you can expect in your coffee. Having this information can guide your choice and help you select a coffee that aligns with your preferences, or you may choose to explore different altitudes to experience the range of flavors available.

**Harvest date**

Coffee is a product that is best enjoyed when it is fresh. When examining a label, it is ideal to look for a harvest date that is less than two years old. While you can certainly try coffee that is older than that, it's important to note that the flavor outcome may be unpredictable. Freshness is a key factor in experiencing the best flavors and aromas in your cup of coffee.

**The producer**

Last but not least, occasionally you will find the name of the producer on the label. This indicates that your coffee truly originates from a specific place and is associated with a particular producer. Having the name of the producer provides an added level of authenticity and traceability, allowing you to connect with the people behind the coffee and appreciate the unique characteristics of the beans.

## Process

To transform coffee cherries into the beloved coffee beans we enjoy, they must undergo two primary processes: washing and drying. While we won't delve into all the intricate details in this article, it is important to note that these processes can significantly impact the taste of your coffee. The specific methods used during washing and drying can influence the flavor profile, acidity, and overall characteristics of the beans. It's worth considering how these processes contribute to the final taste experience when exploring different coffee options.

## Filter or Espresso?

In most cases, coffee is categorized into two main types: filter and espresso. This classification actually reflects the roasting level of the coffee. Filter coffee generally corresponds to a light roast, while espresso coffee is typically a dark roast. It is generally recommended to use filter coffee with slow brewing techniques, such as pour-over or French press, and espresso coffee with an espresso machine. However, it's important to note that you are not strictly limited to these guidelines. You can still use filter coffee in an espresso machine, although the taste profile may differ from what you would typically expect. Ultimately, the choice of roast and brewing method is a matter of personal preference, and you can experiment to find the combination that suits your taste best.

## Roasting date

One of the most crucial pieces of information, and a minimum requirement, is to have the roasting date on the coffee you purchase. Additionally, it may be beneficial to have a suggested maximum consumption date. The optimal period to enjoy your coffee is typically from the 7th day after the roast until the third month after the roast. While you can still use coffee beyond three months, it's important to note that the taste quality will gradually diminish over time. Therefore, for the best flavor experience, it is recommended to consume the coffee within the specified timeframe.

You may not find all of the mentioned information on every coffee package, as it can be quite extensive. However, the minimum details to look for are the coffee origins, roasting date, and flavor notes.
